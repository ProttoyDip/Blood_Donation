          <h2>Why Pulse of Hope?</h2>
          <p>
            Though Bangladesh has more than 160 million people, the number of
            safe blood banks is very few. Without divisional towns, there is
            hardly any blood bank. But a huge amount of blood is needed for
            treatment purposes. A good number of accidents take place every day
            where blood is needed essentially. As a result, people fall in real
            trouble to manage blood. But there are many blood donors who are
            interested in donating blood but donâ€™t know who needs blood. The
            communication gap is resulting in the loss of many lives.
          </p>
